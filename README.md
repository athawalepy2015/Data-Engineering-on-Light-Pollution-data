🌌 Light Pollution Data Engineering Pipeline | Python & Pandas

Developed a complete data engineering workflow using the Globe at Night light pollution dataset, transforming raw, fragmented CSV files into a clean, analysis-ready dataset suitable for downstream analytics and modeling. This project focuses on practical data preparation tasks commonly required in real-world data science work.

The workflow consolidates multi-year observational data, converts categorical fields into numeric and binary features, engineers time-based variables, handles missing values, and produces a structured dataset optimized for exploratory analysis and machine learning.

This project demonstrates hands-on experience with data wrangling, feature engineering, and reproducible data pipelines using Python and Pandas.

🔍 Key Engineering Steps

Combined multi-year CSV files (2014–2024) into a single unified dataset

Converted categorical variables (e.g., cloud cover) into numeric features

Binarized constellation observations using one-hot encoding

Engineered location-based binary features (urban, suburban, rural, remote)

Merged date and time fields into a single datetime column

Handled missing sensor readings and standardized data formats

Produced a reduced, numeric working dataset for future analysis
